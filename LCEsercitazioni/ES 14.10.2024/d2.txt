Another way of writing JSON to a file is by using json.dump() 
method The JSON package has the “dump” function which directly 
writes the dictionary to a file in the form of JSON, without 
needing to convert it into an actual JSON object. It takes 2
 parameters:is the opposite of Serialization, i.e. conversion 
 of JSON objects into their respective Python objects. The load()
  method is used for it. If you have used JSON data from another
   program or obtained it as a string format of JSON, then it can 
   easily be deserialized with load()
, which is usually used to load from a 
string, otherwise, the root object is in a list or Dict.
